# Description

This is a simple web application that renders a calendar where you can add todos on particular dates. Creators of this application is Herman Berglund, Victor Wikstr√∂m and Oscar Andersson.

One of the requirements for this application was to filter todos on different days in the sidebar. However, we chose to create a popup that appears when a user click on a day cell in the calendar. We thought this was a more efficient way of filtering todos that approved the user experience.

Another requirement was to make the application responsive and in doing so, hiding the calendar on mobile screens. We instead came up with a different solution where we move the sidebar below the calendar on smaller screens without compromising the functionality of the tool.
